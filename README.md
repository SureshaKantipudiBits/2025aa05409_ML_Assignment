## a. Problem Statement
A Streamlit web application is developed to:
## b. Dataset Description
## c. Models Used and Evaluation
The following six models were trained and evaluated:
 
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
4. Naive Bayes  
5. Random Forest  
6. XGBoost  

Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)  
- AUC Score 

### Comparison Table
 
| Model                | Accuracy (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | F1 Score (%) | MCC (%) | AUC (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------|---------|---------|
